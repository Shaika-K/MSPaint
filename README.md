This is a very simple version of a MS Paint type sketch made with Processing.
This sketch has been made for th eProcessing worksop for 'Tech Day For Girls' 2018 hosted by VUWWIT.
 
What this sketch does: Like MS paint, it draws filled shapes which consists of rectangles, ellipses and lines, draws with a 'brush', picks colours, and erases (white only).
Additionally it also places a background image to draw or trace over. Undo can also be done via ctrl+z
 
##### BUGS
There are probably some bugs of course, this sketch was made in 6 hours so thats deffnitley likely.
 
Gold star to any outreach girls who can fix this or any bugs!
 
Also forgive my spelling/grammar errors. 
 
Enjoy :)
